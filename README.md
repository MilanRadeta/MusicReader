Soft Computing bachelor project
<br>
OMR (Optical Music Recognition) or Music OCR software, meant to transcribe scanned notes to MIDI and/or MusicXML format.
<br>
A very special thanks to Linn Saxrud Johansen from University of Oslo, whose Master Thesis on Optical Music Recognition helped me to get started.
<br>
I'm not currently working on this project, but I will resume in July.
<br>
Also, since I've noticed this repository's been getting attention, I will prepare the presentation in English, since the current one is in Serbian.
