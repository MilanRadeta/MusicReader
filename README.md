# MusicReader
Soft Computing project
OMR (Optical Music Recognition) or Music OCR software, meant to transcribe scanned notes to MIDI and/or MusicXML format.
A very special thanks to Linn Saxrud Johansen from University of Oslo, whose Master Thesis on Optical Music Recognition helped me to get started. Most of the functionality is implemented according to it, with slight modifications.
